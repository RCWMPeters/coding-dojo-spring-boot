Leaseplan Digital assessment / DIQQ recruitment agency
---
**DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME**

A weekend of my life was wasted working on this assessment.
 
I was given the link to the assessment on a friday afternoon.

I mailed the link to my work sunday afternoon. Little over a week later the only feedback I received from 
the recruiter was that Leaseplan Digital did not want to proceed with me. That's it. No explanation, no nothing.
The recruiter promised me (as they do) he would get in touch with me to provide me with more detail, but that didn't happen.

Maybe they had valid reasons to reject me, maybe they didn't (obviously the latter is my opinion). But fact is that 
they acted very disrespectful by not providing me any feedback in return for the work I had done. Consider yourself warned.
